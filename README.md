What is it?
----------

Chirpy intends to be a very small utility used for manipulating exported
CSV files from a hamradio programming tool called Chirp, from the
command line. As such, to make best use of Chirpy, one should have
Chirp installed, as well as be familiar with how to use it.
----------

Requirements
Python >= 2.7 because of Argparse, other than that everything else is
just dependent on the Python standard library circa 2.4.
----------

Usage:
TBD, still need to write the code!
